# youtube-trending

This repository is made by Noor Drissi, Jason Jabbour, and Harish Karumuri as a project for SYS 2022 at the University of Virginia. The goal was to conduct some data analysis on YouTube trending video data, which was collected from the YouTube API and made available on Kaggle by Mitchell J (https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new/discussion). The powerpoint attached contains the findings. 

The 'FINAL PROJECT CODE.R' contains the all code in a clean format and should be comprehensive and representative of the graphics and analysis of our data. 

Please download the repository as it contains files needed to run the code, specifically the data files. 

To provide some clarity to the chaos, here is a note on some of the other files work was done in:
- exploration.R: contains the code for attaching the category names to the id
- final_project_try2.R: some analysis done to get an idea for the presence of talk show hosts. 
- uplaods.xlsx: Data pulled from social blade on view count.
