The 'FINAL PROJECT CODE.R' contains the code in a much cleaner format and should be comprehensive and representative of the graphics and analysis of our data. 

Please download the repository as it contains files needed to run the code. 

However, to provide some clarity to the chaos, here is a note on some of the other files work was done in:
- exploration.R: contains the code for attaching the category names to the id
- final_project_try2.R: some analysis done to get an idea for the presence of talk show hosts. 
- uplaods.xlsx: Data pulled from social blade on view count.
